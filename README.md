Bios 611 Project 1
==================
COVID19 Labor Statistics
------------------------

The economic effects of COVID19 have disproportionately affected people with lower socioeconomic status and those who worked in industries affected by lockdowns.

The goal of this project is to identify what groups have been most affected and attempt to quantify the losses. This project will use data from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics which contains detailed information on employment losses for various groups of the population.

Data from other sources may be included in the project, such as state level unemployment data to determine if different groups were affected in different regions. Additionally, modeling may be performed to determine if the intensity of the pandemic (deaths or cases) is related to the economic impact in a state.
